# Data Wrangling, Analysis, and AB Testing UC Davis Coursera Course Case Study

A project serving as a case study for AB testing analysis. The goal of the project was to see if there were increases in product views after a change in product landing pages and if there were increases in product sales after the  inclusion of a follow up email. For both scenarios, the outcomes were measured within 30 days of the test implementation. After establishing both tests, the results were checked for statistical significance with a 95% confidence interval calculation. 
 
* Simulated the process of creating an AB Test using SQL.
* Used CASE, CAST, JOINS, and subqueries to clean tables and create binary metrics.
